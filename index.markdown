<p>You must be registered for GST to claim GST credits.</p>
<p>You can claim a credit for any GST included in the price you pay for things that you use in your business. This is called a GST credit (or input-tax credit, a credit for the tax included in the price of your business inputs).</p>
<p>You claim GST credits in your activity statement.</p>
<p>You can claim GST credits if the following four conditions apply:</p>
<ul>
<li>you intend to use your purchase solely or partly in carrying on your business and the purchase does not relate to making input-taxed supplies</li>
<li>the purchase price included GST</li>
<li>you provide, or are liable to provide, payment for the item you purchased</li>
<li>you have a tax invoice from your supplier (for purchases more than $82.50).</li>
</ul>
<p>A four-year time limit applies.</p>

<h2>When you need a tax invoice</h2>

<p>You must have a tax invoice to claim a GST credit for purchases that cost more than $82.50 (including GST). Your supplier has 28 days to provide you with a tax invoice after you request one. Wait until you receive it before you claim the GST credit, even if this is in a later reporting period.</p>

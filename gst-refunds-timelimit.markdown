<p>Self-assessment applies to amounts under indirect tax laws for tax periods starting on or after 1 July 2012 and includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>goods and services tax (GST)</li>
<li>luxury car tax (LCT)</li>
<li>wine equalisation tax (WET)</li>
<li>fuel tax credits.</li>
</ul>
<p>Self-assessment allows for a four-year period of review, during which time we may amend an assessment.</p>
<p>The period of review replaces the four-year time limits for the recovery of unpaid amounts and the entitlement to unclaimed refunds that apply to tax periods and fuel tax periods starting before 1 July 2012.</p>
<p>During the period of review, your assessment may be amended at your request or at our discretion. The period of review starts on the day we give notice of the assessment and ends four years from the day after the notice of assessment was given. Where an assessment is amended, it is subject to a refreshed period of review but only for that particular amendment.</p>
<p>In limited circumstances, we may make amendments outside the period of review. In addition, the period of review may be extended where, during an examination of your affairs, we apply to the Federal Court for an extension or you agree to an extension at our request.</p>
<p>Unlike the four-year time limits that apply to tax periods starting before 1 July 2012, your entitlement to an indirect tax refund cannot be preserved outside of the period of review by either you notifying us or us notifying you of an entitlement.</p>
<p>Your entitlement to a GST credit ceases if it is not taken into account in an assessment within a period of four years. The four-year time limit for claiming a GST credit ends four years from the due date of the activity statement for the earliest tax period in which you would have been able to claim the GST credit - setting aside any requirement to hold a tax invoice. The GST credit can be claimed in any tax period within the four-year period.</p>

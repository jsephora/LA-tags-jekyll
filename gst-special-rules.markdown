<p>Special rules for claiming GST credits apply to a number of specific types of purchases, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pre-establishment costs</a> of setting up a company</li>
<li>Second-hand goods</li>
<li>Other special rules.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Pre-establishment costs</h2>
<p>If you're setting up a company, the company can claim GST credits for the GST included in the price of some purchases you make before the company comes into existence, such as set-up fees, business registration, trading stock and business premises.</p>
<p>To claim GST credits for these pre-establishment costs the following seven criteria must apply:</p>
<ul>
<li>the purchase must be for the purpose of bringing the company into existence or carrying on a business after it comes into existence</li>
<li>the company must come into existence and be registered for GST no more than six months after the purchase</li>
<li>you must become a member, officer or employee of the company</li>
<li>the company must have fully reimbursed you for the cost of the purchase</li>
<li>the purchase must not be used to make input-taxed sales or for private purposes</li>
<li>the company must not be entitled to a GST credit for the purchase, if it subsequently acquires the thing from you</li>
<li>you must not be entitled to claim a GST credit for the purchase.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Second-hand goods</h2>
<p>You can claim a GST credit for any second-hand goods you buy from unregistered suppliers for the purposes of sale or exchange but not for manufacture (even though GST is not included in the price of the goods), provided you meet certain conditions.</p>
